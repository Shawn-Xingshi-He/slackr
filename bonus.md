(optional) TODO!
In addition to achieving all the features specified in milestones 1,2,3,4&5, 
I also made many additional features BY MYSELF(without use of API):

    1.Each channel or user that the mouse moves to will show a flashing bar with different colors, reminding the user that this is a different list.

    2.Besides realizing the feature of "it should display their profile screen if you click on a users' name on a given message"(2.4.2), You can also click a given user on the channel/user list(left side) to get their profile.

    3.I added a small purple "you" on the user list to indicate who you are logging in, and if you click it, you can go to your own profile and update info(profile button on the top right corner can also do this :)), other users are listed in alphabetical order.

    4.In the top right corner of a given channel window, if you click 'member button',
    it will show member/non-member lists respectively in alphabetical order. You can multi-select users to add to current channel, those 'new members' will  'jump' to
    member list immediately.

    5.On all parts which you can click in a given channel, the cursor should change in some ways.

    6.A Photo will be first shown in the message input part before to be sent.

    7.When you are enlarging a photo, there are two arrows which allow you to view other photos backwardly/forwardly, don't worry about browsing to the last/first one, because it is a "circulating pattern" (reach the last go to the fist).
